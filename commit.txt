`git commit -m "message for the commit"`

This command is used to take a snapshot of your project's tracked files at a specific point in time.
It effectively saves the current state of your staged changes into the repository's history.
Its done because if we ever want to revert to the previous state of the code due to some problem/bug/error, so we fallback to older commits.
